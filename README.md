# My-Maths

The very first game/app that I created back in highschool.

This started off as a Science Student Reasearch Project about the effects of different types of music being played while trying to solve simple maths equations.
I really enjoyed working on it so I ended up continuing with it and eventually publishing it to the app store.

The game basically asks you a bunch of simple maths equations (6+12=, 9x6=, 33/11=) depending on which category of questions you choose and gives you a set amount of time to answer as many questions as you can

It's quite basic, but it was my first game so I'm pretty happy.
